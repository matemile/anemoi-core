# Accumulated inputs and related reduced timescale accumulatations (example: 6h inputs -> 1h outputs)
# - Put accumulated inputs (e.g., tp_accum, cp_accum) in `forcing`.
# - Put their related reduced timescale accumulatations (e.g., tp, cp) in `diagnostic` so they are predicted but NOT used as inputs.
# - Ensure `normalizer.remap` maps the reduced timescale accumulatations to their accumulated counterparts for statistics
#   (e.g., tp -> tp_accum, cp -> cp_accum) so the outputs use the correct scale.
# - Use `normalizer.std` for the accumulated inputs (tp_accum, cp_accum) to preserve zero as zero.
# - Add `processors.zero_overwriter` for the accumulated inputs with `time_index: [0]` so the first time slice in each input window is zeroed.
#   This is critical when preparing, for example, 6-hour accumulated inputs while training/interpolating at 1-hour resolution.

# Time frequency requested from dataset

# features that are not part of the forecast state
# but are used as forcing to generate the forecast state
# NOTE: Place accumulated input features here (e.g., tp_accum, cp_accum) when
#       the model consumes accumulations (e.g., 6h sums) and outputs higher-resolution
#       instantaneous fields (e.g., 1h).

# NOTE: If doing mass-conserving accumulations, put the reduced time scale accumulation outputs related to the accumulated inputs here.
#       For example, if training to predict hourly tp/cp using 6-hour accumulated inputs
#       tp_accum/cp_accum, then keep `tp` and `cp` in `diagnostic`.

  # Map reduced timescale accumulatation variables to the statistics of their accumulated inputs.
  # Example: when using 6h tp_accum/cp_accum as inputs and predicting 1h tp/cp, use:
  #   - tp -> tp_accum
  #   - cp -> cp_accum
  # This ensures the outputs use the appropriate scale from the accumulated features.
  # The existing cp note applies if FractionBounding is enabled for cp (cp as a fraction of tp).
  # NOTE: This remap should only be applied if FractionBounding is enabled for cp.
